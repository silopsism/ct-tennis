# CPT Tennis League 2026

Live standings and fixture results, read straight from the **Results Entry** tab of the league's Google Sheet each time the page loads (and every 5 minutes while open).

- No build step: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`.
- The sheet must stay shared as "anyone with the link can view", and the Results Entry tab name and column headers must stay the same.
- Standings are calculated from the results: a fixture counts once scores are entered; win/draw/loss is matches won, then sets won; points come from Home/Away Final Pts (so overrides apply). Ranked on points, then sets difference, then sets for.

- By week view: score shown as matches, sets or points; the wand projects the rest of the season (Bradley–Terry on sets won, walkovers excluded, home edge measured from all results).
- Tapping an upcoming or projected tile lets a viewer enter their own score. It is stored only in that browser (`localStorage`), counts in the standings and projection, and is dropped automatically once the official result is in the sheet.
