# CPT Tennis League 2026

Live standings and fixture results, read straight from the **Results Entry** tab of the league's Google Sheet each time the page loads (and every 5 minutes while open).

- No build step: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`.
- The sheet must stay shared as "anyone with the link can view", and the Results Entry tab name and column headers must stay the same.
- Standings are calculated from the results: a fixture counts once scores are entered; win/draw/loss is matches won, then sets won; points come from Home/Away Final Pts (so overrides apply). Ranked on points, then sets difference, then sets for.

Run locally with `python -m http.server` and open http://localhost:8000.
